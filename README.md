# CS---305

Atremis Finacial is a Finacial comapnay that asked us to increase the sercurity of their application to meet industry standards.

When we found the clients security vulnerabilities we implemented patches and fixes for the vulnerabilities that had them. It is important to code securly so that vulnerabilities do not pop up and create backdoors and issues that hackers and people can exploit. 
Software security adds a type of insurance that you cant buy in a way that your appliaations and data will be safer in the overall internet landscape.

Creating the checksum was a bit difficult as figueing out why it would not connect to the host took some to=ime to troubleshoot.

We implemeted the SHA-256 algorithm, we immplemented HTTPS, and also included the dependency check for the application. 

I ran the code to make sure it was all working and also ran the depedency check to investigate any known vulnerabilities.

Implemeting the plugins as well as troubleshooting MAVEN should be helpfull in the future

The dependecy check aswell as gereneatong the certificate would be helpful to show.
